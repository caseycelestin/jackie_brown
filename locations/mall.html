		    		<p>The creation of The Del Amo Mall came from an amalgamation of many shopping centers during the sixties and seventies. With the <a href="http://blogs.dailybreeze.com/history/2011/12/08/marriage-of-the-malls/">“Marriage of the Malls”</a> in 1981 made the shopping center the largest in the world until 1992 and the opening of the Mall of America in Minnesota. The boom of suburban Los Angeles allowed for a mall of this magnitude to not only live but thrive in the materialistic environment of the eighties. Films like Valley Girl (Coolidge, 1983), which was filmed in the mall (I have included a picture from the film), highlight the shallow, consumerist characters that occupied the malls of Southern California.</p>
		    		<p>With the 2006 Recession and the growing popularity of e-commerce, malls in America began to see much lower attendance in the 2000’s and what some predicted to be the death of the malls. The Del Amo mall was no exception to this and growing up in the 2000’s, this was the mall I was exposed to. It was truly a sad sight going to this vast building and seeing no one there. A cathedral to suburban sprawl of Los Angeles, it laid empty, not forgotten but unused. It was a testament to an optimistic America, one that is mocked by 2000’s America as being naive and excessive. A pessimistic America detested the mall and so it stood their, lightly used whenever someone had the courage to spend money.</p>
		    		<p>The Mall has since underwent 200 million dollar renovation, bringing people back to the mall. No longer in a recession, suburban America has embraced the mall again. With the renovation though, all of the defining characteristics of the original mall have been erased. The International Food Court, where Jackie Brown sets the stage for her heist, is lost somewhere in the new development. The new food court is on the other side of the mall, complete with Chipotle. The new mall has been built, tailored to the new tastes of consumers, but one has to ask the question is this ‘new’ mall following the same footstep of the original one? When times are tough again, consumers will look at this new mall with disdain; and like building on a burial ground, the old mall will loom, as if sealing the fate of this new optimistic mall.</p>
