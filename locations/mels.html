	    		<p>Melanie’s apartment, situated right on the Pacific Ocean in the beach city of Hermosa Beach, is the hangout pad of Ordell and his cronies. The environment is the embodiment of the stereotypes of California surfer culture. Beach attire is worn as lounging clothes, copious amounts of marijuana is used, loose sexual encounters, and so on. People come and go, things happen, but none of it phases Melanie. In the character Melanie, Tarantino is portraying the mentality of the people who live in cities like Hermosa Beach throughout Los Angeles.</p>
	    		<p>In a city that is as ethnically diverse as Los Angeles, the beach cities stand out as relatively untouched bastions of white neighborhoods. Hermosa Beach’s percentage of white residents sits at <a href="http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/ethnicity/white/neighborhood/list/">84.9%</a>, making it the ninth the whitest city in Los Angeles County according to the 2000 United States Census. This all reinforces the idea that the ‘California Dreaming’, easy living lifestyle, is a white lifestyle. Ordell and Jackie, in contrast, have to work to survive. They dont have the luxury of living the slow, simple lifestyle that Melanie is afforded. </p>
	    		<p>The only other character who looks like they truly fit into the lifestyle is Louis, the other white member of Ordell’s crew. The audience watched two hard working black characters put everything on the line to survive while the two white accomplices accomplish nothing. Although, it is important to mention that both die at the end of the film and one can make the argument that the only thing that they did accomplish during the entirety of the film was getting themselves killed.</p>
	    		<p>This divide in lifestyles is highlighted by a conversation between Ordell and Louis at Cockatoo Inn. Suspicions of Melanie’s interest in stealing Ordell’s money, Louis asks him why he “keeps her around”. Ordell responds by explaining that “she’s my fine little Surfer Girl” but then states she is not as pretty as she used to be and complains a whole lot. In a last comment though, as if to redeem Melanie for her looks and complaints, Ordell adds “but she’s white…”. Ordell like to keep Melanie around because he gets a glimpse into a life he is not allowed in. To have his white little surfer girl from Hermosa Beach to him is a treat; something he will tolerate even she is not a great use to him.</p>
